Here are some commments which will help you run the file and view results.

1. All codes are present in the pca_nmf_proj folder

2. The functions nmf_main('learn',101) and nmf_main('learn',10125) need to be run before the code.m can be executed. Please make sure the exp file corresponding to these two are created before (by running them)

3. The code.m file contains the MATLAB code which you are required to run

4. Results would be stored in a separate results folder. Make sure to create this folder before running the code.

5. Refer to code.html in ./pca_proj/html for the report.
